    "During the past few decades, the availability of cheap computers, nano satellites and innovative telescopes have led to a treasure trove of data and information in the field of astronomy and earth sciences. Even though such a vast amount of data is available, it is often not well-structured or standardized. This makes it difficult to not only explore but also discover relevant datasets especially for amateur scientists and enthusiasts in turn creating an entry barrier for those interested in scientific data."
